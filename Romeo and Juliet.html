<b4>

    <font face="Arial">


Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows<br>
Doth with their death bury their parents'strife.<br>
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,<br>
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>

No, for then we should be colliers.
